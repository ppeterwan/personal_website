    The market sector I am currently interested in is the new retail in the fresh market. 
    Before the COVID-19, 70% of the Chinese fresh market were taken either by farmers’ markets or individual retailers,  
    20% were taken by supermarkets, and only 5% were taken by online sales channels. 
    The outbreak of coronavirus changed people’s behavior in China and pushed people to accept new retail 
    because farmers’ markets were all closed and people were restricted from going outdoors. The order 
    volume of leading new retail players in the fresh market such as Yonghui supermarket, hemaxiansheng, 
    and chaojiwuzhong, were increased by twice to four times, and stock price of yonghui supermarket were 
    increased by more than 30% during the pandemic. The fresh market size for new retail is 5.4 trillion RMB 
    and in the next five year, it will increase to 7 trillion RMB. The market space is still large and the 
    companies become more normalized and systematic which will bring a higher valuation premium. I 
    believe that there will be many M&A or IPO opportunities in the future, 
    especially at this time when the market is reconsidering the valuation of the sector post-pandemic."""
